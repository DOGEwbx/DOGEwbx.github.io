## Introduction

I'm a junior student from Yuanpei College, Peking University major in data science and minor in economy. You can check my CV at [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WiPJp24u0azULi5Q7JzUngc6SQGNJjTH), you can also check my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/w/Wang:Bingxuan) page to learn about some of my current works.

I used to do some reasearches in OCR and knowledge distillation. Recently my interest comes to federated learning and block chain. If you are curious about these areas, you can email me and we can share some learning materials or ideas together.

As a guy with strong curiousity, i'd like to explore everything I haven't experienced. So please let me know if you have any crazy thoughts! Usually I can give you some useful feedback.

## Something Personal

I am a fan of Royal Never Give Up, an e-sports team of League of Legend.
